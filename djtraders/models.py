"""
Cleaned-up models generated from `manage.py inspectdb` (see
rev_engineer_models.py for the raw, unedited output). inspectdb reads
an existing database's tables and writes a first-draft model per table,
but leaves manual work behind: every model here is set managed=False
(this app reads a database Django didn't create, so it should never try
to migrate these tables), model names were singularized (Category,
Customer, ...) and reordered so each is defined before anything that
references it by bare class name, and every foreign key was given a
real on_delete (inspectdb defaults to DO_NOTHING) matching what should
actually happen when the related row is removed.

Beyond that baseline, most models add a few computed @property values
(e.g. Order.order_total, Customer.formatted_address) and a couple carry
classmethods used by views.py: *.search() backs a list page's search
form, and Employee.authenticate/Customer.authenticate back this app's
two hand-rolled logins (no django.contrib.auth involved). Each one's
own docstring below explains the specifics.

# way: get a queryset of OrderDetail rows for that portal's user, pass
# it to _lines_frame, group with pandas, and hand the result to
# _bar_figure. Revenue is each line's unit_price * quantity *
# (1 - discount), the same formula as OrderDetail.line_total -- not
# Product.unit_price, which is today's list price and ignores both
# discounts and any price change since the order was placed.

    Builds one bar chart the same way for every chart on the dashboard:
    a bar per row of data, each bar its own color (see CHART_COLORS),
    plus (when trend=True) a dashed linear trend line over the bars.

    data is a DataFrame already in display order; category is the
    column of bar names and value the column of bar lengths.
    color_names is the full set of names to assign colors from (so a
    chart showing only the top ten products still uses the same colors
    as a chart showing all of them); it defaults to data[category].

    The trend line is a straight least-squares fit (np.polyfit,
    degree 1) of value against bar position, 0, 1, 2, ... For
    time-ordered bars (months, years) that is a real trend. For bars
    sorted by size (products, categories) it is the average rate at
    which the bars fall off from largest to smallest. The product and
    category charts pass trend=False for that reason: the line says
    little about bars already sorted by size. The fitted line is clamped at zero,
    since a negative revenue or unit count makes no sense.

    Every bar is labeled with its value at the end of the bar: whole
    units for the quantity column, whole dollars for anything else. Pass
    text (a list of labels, one per bar) to replace those labels; the
    supplier chart does, to show percentages. Pass hover (a list of strings, one
    per bar, with <br> for line breaks) to replace the hover box's text, as the
    revenue-over-time chart does to add the order count. Plotly needs room beyond
    the longest bar for the label, so the value axis is stretched 25%
    (55% for long labels like dollars plus a percentage) past the largest bar,
    and the label font is 11 pt.

    Every figure gets an explicit height: left unset, Plotly sizes to
    its container, and inside the dashboard's equal-height cards that
    container's height depends on the figure itself, so the chart
    collapses to a sliver.
