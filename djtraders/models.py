"""
The app's models, cleaned up from `manage.py inspectdb` (rev_engineer_models.py
has the raw output). Every model is managed=False, because this app reads a
database Django didn't create and must never migrate those tables. Names are
singular, models are ordered so each is defined before anything that references
it by bare class name, and every foreign key has a real on_delete (inspectdb
defaults to DO_NOTHING).

On top of that the models add computed @property values (e.g.
Order.order_total), search() classmethods that back the list pages,
authenticate() classmethods for the hand-rolled logins (no django.contrib.auth),
and, for the dashboards, methods that return Plotly charts built with the
helpers in charts.py.
