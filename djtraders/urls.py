"""
URL configuration for the djtraders app.

Each Django *app* gets its own urls.py so its routes stay self-contained;
the project-level urls.py (DjangoTraders/urls.py) "includes" this file
under a prefix. Every route below is a path() call bound to a name --
templates/views reverse() a URL by that name (e.g.
"djtraders:customer_detail") instead of hard-coding the path string, so
a path can change here without hunting down every place it's linked
from.

Path converters (<str:customer_id>, <int:order_id>, ...) capture a
segment of the URL and pass it to the view as a keyword argument, typed
to match that model's primary key -- <str:...> for Customer's
CharField id, <int:...> for the AutoField ids (Product, Order,
Employee).

A few routes need a specific order in urlpatterns below: customer_create_url
must come before customer_detail_url, since <str:customer_id> would
otherwise happily match the literal word "create" as a customer_id
(Django tries patterns top to bottom and stops at the first match).

order_build/order_add_line/order_commit are keyed by customer_id, not
an order_id -- an in-progress order is only ever session state
(request.session["cart"], see views.py) until order_commit writes it
to the database, so there's no Order row yet to key a URL by. order_
detail/order_delete act on a real, already-placed Order row, so they
stay keyed by order_id.
