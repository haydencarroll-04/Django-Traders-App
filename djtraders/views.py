"""
View functions for the djtraders app.

Browsing (open to anyone): home, customer_list/product_list (search
handled by each model's own search() classmethod, djtraders/models.py),
customer_detail/product_detail, order_detail.

Two logins, each hand-rolled with plain sessions instead of Django's
own auth system: login_view/logout_view (employee, session key
"current_user") and customer_login_view/customer_logout_view (customer,
session key "customer_id"). Only one of the two can be logged in at a
time -- landing on either login page logs out whoever was there before.

Self-service access rule: a logged-in customer may only view/edit their
own record (or build/commit their own cart, below); an employee may act
on any customer's. The four helpers at the top of this file
(_own_customer_redirect, _customer_edit_denied, _order_access_denied,
_order_cart_denied) enforce that rule wherever it applies, instead of
repeating the same session checks in every view. The employee and
supplier pages have their own rules (_employee_access_denied,
_supplier_access_denied, next to those pages' views).

Customer edit/create: customer_edit renders a Django ModelForm
(CustomerEditForm, djtraders/forms.py) through django-crispy-forms.
customer_create reuses customer_edit's own template and form for a
Customer that doesn't exist yet. customer_delete marks a customer
inactive instead of deleting the row.

Ordering: a customer's in-progress order lives in
request.session["cart"] (a plain dict, no database row) until
order_commit writes it out as a real Order plus its OrderDetail rows,
inside one transaction. order_create/order_build/order_add_line/order_remove_line/
order_clear_cart/order_commit walk through that flow, open to the
cart's own customer or to any employee (_order_cart_denied); order_delete
cancels an already-placed order on the same day it was placed.

    Public "Create a FREE Account" page, linked from customer_login.html:
    a brand-new customer registers themselves. Compare to customer_create,
    the employee-only version of the same idea, where an employee adds a
    customer on their behalf and nobody is logged in as a result.

    CustomerSignupForm (djtraders/forms.py) asks for every column the
    customers table tracks, except customer_id (generated here, from the
    validated company name, by Customer.generate_customer_id -- a customer
    never picks it) and inactive_date (left blank, so the account starts
    out active). Nothing is written until the whole form passes validation.

    On success the new customer is logged straight in (the same
    "customer_id" session key customer_login_view sets) and sent to their
    own customer_detail page with a welcome message, instead of being made
    to find their company in the login dropdown they just joined.

    Same one-session-at-a-time rule as the two login views: landing on this
    page logs out whoever was logged in before, employee or customer.

    The ID is generated and saved inside one transaction, as an insert-only
    save. If two people register the same company name at the very same
    instant, both can be handed the same ID and the database's primary key
    rejects the second -- shown as an ordinary "try again" form error
    rather than a server error (or, worse, overwriting the first customer).

    AJAX endpoint (the Quantity box on each row of order_build.html,
    DjangoTraders.js's UpdateCartQuantities) -- sets one cart line's
    quantity to exactly the number typed, where order_add_line would add
    that number on top of what's already there. Returns JSON in the same
    shape as order_add_line (row_html, product_id, order_total), so the
    page can swap in the refreshed row and the new total without a reload.

    Only quantity is ever read from the POST. The line's discount is not
    touched, so this can't be used to get one (a customer can't) and an
    employee's discount survives the change; _cart_lines re-prices the line
    from its new quantity, so crossing the volume-discount threshold in
    either direction (more than 10 units) adds or drops that automatic 10%
    on its own. The rules for the number itself (at least 1, no more than
    the stock on hand) are OrderLineQuantityForm's.

    Only a product that is already in the cart can be updated -- this never
    creates a line (that's order_add_line), and a quantity below 1 is
    refused rather than treated as a removal (that's order_remove_line).
    POST-only, same self-service access check as the other cart views.

    JSON is only the answer to an AJAX call (jQuery marks every one with
    an X-Requested-With header). If the row's form is submitted the
    ordinary way instead -- JavaScript blocked, or the page is running an
    old saved copy of DjangoTraders.js that has no UpdateCartQuantities
    yet -- the same checks run, but the answer is a redirect back to the
    cart, with any problem shown as a red message at the top of the page.
    Either way nobody is left looking at a page of raw JSON.
